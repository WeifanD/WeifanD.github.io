<p>hey, guys!

My name is Weifan or just simply call me Blair, named for one of female chief actress in Gossip Girl drama, quite easy to remember, right?! After graduated from University of Glasgow with a Master degree in Statistics, I've worked as a data analyst since then. 

In my spare time, as a blogger, I like to write and read other's technical blogs regarding how to be myself better and how to deal with real problems in a more efficient way. As for my sport interest, I could not deny my greatest interest is swimming, which brings me a lot of freedom and health. 

Hopefully, you can find more interesting pieces here. Let me know if you have any question or suggestion!

<p>喜欢visualization的伪技术宅。一点点 geek，一丢丢的执著，就像吃烧烤时多少会撒一点孜然，恰到好处就够。这里是我与颜嵘的知识记录与分享之地，他山之石，可以攻玉，每天记录一点点，快乐多一点。</p>

> Live long and prosper.

<p> Here comes my turn. My name is Yanrong and I am highly intrigued in everything on bone, especially on its interaction with immune system. I'd like to share my daily experience on clinical practice and everything in my memory that I want to share now, plus what I imagine beyond. 

记忆，进展，超越。专注，缓慢，持续。
